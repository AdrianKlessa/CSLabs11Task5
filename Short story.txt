There once was a boy named Nick.
He had a fortune-telling cat named Jack. Nick and Jack had many adventures together, utilizing their abilities to save the world. Their biggest struggle so far was fighting the secret organisation named X'age'Noa bent on bringing Cthulhu back to this world.

However, they managed to succeed, and lived happily ever after.
The end.
