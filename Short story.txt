There once was a girl named Nico.
She had a fortune-telling cat named Jack. Nico and Jack had many adventures together, utilizing their abilities to save the world.
Their biggest struggle so far was having to stop a certain scientist from creating a time travel device and causing World War III.
There was also the time when they had to deal with the secret organisation named X'age'Noa bent on bringing Cthulhu back to this world.

However, they managed to succeed, and lived happily ever after.

The end.
